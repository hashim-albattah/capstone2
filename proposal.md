# Shoe Classifier ML Model
## Idea
* Shoe Type and Brand Classifier Using Shoe Image Data
  * Train a model on images of different shoe types (sneaker, boot, etc.) and different designs corresponding to different brands, with the capability of determining what shoe type is in the image, and the brand of that shoe (i.e. nike's check, addidas 3 stripe, van's tag, etc.)
