# Capstone 2 Proposals
## Proposal 1
* LoL World Championship Predictor (based on features from previous tournaments) 
  * I am going to use this Medium article [here](https://medium.com/mad-lions-e-c/lol-data-solution-2b4bead4a51) about extracting LoL data from the Riot Games API  and Oracleâ€™s Elixir. If you look at the end of the article, there are images of the resulting datasets, and a lot of that player data can be used as features for predicting their progress in the tournament
## Proposal 2 (Most likelhy the one I'm doing)
* Shoe Type and Brand Classifier Using Shoe Image Data
  * Train a model on images of different shoe types (sneaker, boot, etc.) and different designs corresponding to different brands, with the capability of determining what shoe type is in the image, and the brand of that shoe (i.e. nike's check, addidas 3 stripe, van's tag, etc.)
  * [Inspiration](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/finegrained/utzap50k/) for shoe type classifier

## Proposal 3
* Sport Classifier Using Auditory Data
  * Identifying what sport is being played based off of in-match / crowd audio (without commentators).
